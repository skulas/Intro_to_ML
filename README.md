# Intro to ML
Where to start if you are planning to start learning Machine Learning by yourself.

I started learning ML by myself. Very soon I understood it's not a limited domain with a finite set of tools to gain. NO.
It's an endless learning slope.

With this notebook I want to help you focus and figure out where to start, without getting lost in the AI Universe.

For any questions you can drop me a line.
If there is something wrong or not working also let me know, please.

Otherwise you can setup a Python environment with jupyter in it and play around with the notebook.

I really put a lot of effort on this. Hope you like it and that I saved you a few days.
